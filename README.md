## Inspiration
The design inspiration comes from Dribbble, via [this][shot] link.


## Info
State management is [bloc][bloc] and I have try to follow bloc pattern to implement, the cryptocurrency data are from [Coingecko][api] API's.


## Tasks
The following are some tasks I haven't done and you can do them if you're interested:

- [ ] Enhance swap coin
- [ ] Add setting screen
- [ ] Get more coin list by end of screen
- [ ] delete or update coin assets
- [ ] Add [bloc hydrated][hydrated]
